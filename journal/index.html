        <h2>Entry 2 - Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
        <time datetime="2024-02-01">February 1, 2024</time>
        <p>I read Naema Baskanderi’s article, <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">“Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows.”</a> After reading the article, I learned a lot about how to make a “perfect” modal window. Before reading the article, I was first thrown off by why she had introduced this concept of a modal window because I personally found pop-ups really annoying, but she gave me a new insight and view about having them pop up on users’ windows and screens. Being able to capture users’ attention for a brief moment for something important is very important, making sure the users will fill out some needed information or double checking before they try to delete something. Baskanderi gives detailed information about the “perfect” modal window to ensure task completion, which was really interesting to see. She provided all the information about what a proper modal window needs to be accessible for different users and for it to be less confusing for users, which was all useful information for when I need to make a modal window in the future. </p>

        <h2>Entry 1 - Research Form Design</h2>

        <p>While reading the article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">“Best practices for form design”</a> I realized that while setting up passwords for websites, it is sometimes gimmicky. The article mentioned how if a password requires special letters and formatting, to explain the formatting through “support text.” After looking at the image, I realized that if I saw that type of support text while signing up on websites, it’d make the experience a lot better and simpler. Having requirements in bullet points spaced further apart, made it a lot easier to read and understand. Whereas sometimes while I am signing up for accounts on websites, I want to get it over as soon as possible, so I would rush the passwords without fully reading the requirements they need for a password if it’s in a long sentence or paragraph. And then, when I submitted the password, they would send me back with an error message since I didn’t have what they needed. But if a lot more websites were to adopt the way Ansari had formatted the text, it would be a lot simpler and make it a lot easier and faster to sign up.</p>
        <p>A website I have recently interacted with is <a href="https://www.target.com/">Target</a>. Target has really good form practices due to its contrast, hierarchy, and labels. The contrast in the website is good since the buttons are all red with white text, allowing their users to be able to read the text clearly. The hierarchy and labels within the website are great as well, the hierarchy while checking out makes it easier for users to go in order and know what to do; whereas the label are inline labels, but once users tap or click into it, it jumps up to right above to let users know what to fill in the label in case they had forgotten. One fascinating thing I realized with Target is that whereas people avoid the red buttons in all websites and apps, for Target, people automatically gravitate towards the red buttons.</p>
