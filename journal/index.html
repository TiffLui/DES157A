        <p>While reading the article “Best practices for form design” I realized that while setting up passwords for websites, it is sometimes gimmicky. The article mentioned how if a password requires special letters and formatting, to explain the formatting through “support text.” After looking at the image, I realized that if I saw that type of support text while signing up on websites, it’d make the experience a lot better and simpler. Having requirements in bullet points spaced further apart, made it a lot easier to read and understand. Whereas sometimes while I am signing up for accounts on websites, I want to get it over as soon as possible, so I would rush the passwords without fully reading the requirements they need for a password if it’s in a long sentence or paragraph. And then, when I submitted the password, they would send me back with an error message since I didn’t have what they needed. But if a lot more websites were to adopt the way Ansari had formatted the text, it would be a lot simpler and make it a lot easier and faster to sign up.</p>
        <p>A website I have recently interacted with is Target. Target has really good form practices due to its contrast, hierarchy, and labels. The contrast in the website is good since the buttons are all red with white text, allowing their users to be able to read the text clearly. The hierarchy and labels within the website are great as well, the hierarchy while checking out makes it easier for users to go in order and know what to do; whereas the labels are inline labels, but once users tap or click into it, it jumps up to right above to let users know what to fill in the label in case they had forgotten. One fascinating thing I realized with Target is that whereas people avoid the red buttons in all websites and apps, for Target, people automatically gravitate towards the red buttons.</p>
