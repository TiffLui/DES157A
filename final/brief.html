    <h1>- Final Project Brief - </h1>
    
    <article>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>For the final project, I will be updating my Every Picture project, because I was really inspired to incorporate a game aspect into it, making it seem more Pokemon-like.</p>

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>For the project, I will be focusing on more functionality by incorporating a game from Game On. Such as the monster fighting game example. For this project, I want to add a battle after people click onto the pokeball, where people get the option to “catch” the nanoblocks they have found. I think that’d be a lot more interesting than just learning about what the nanoblock is. It’d also have a lot more interaction with the site, which I think would be fun for people. I’m planning on making a button for the people to “run away” or escape as well. So that’s more of a tribute to the pokemon games.</p>

        <h2>Expert Feedback</h2>
        <p>I plan to get feedback from my friend who works at Audible. He’s a backend developer, but he has expertise in frontend development as well. He also works with many frontend developers, so he can give me lots of feedback and more insight on how to improve my project further. I could also ask him if he could have one of his friends who is working on frontend to give more feedback, so that way I have more opinions.</p>
