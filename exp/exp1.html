    <!-- With this code, I attempted to write a loop that makes 7 calls to console.log to output a triangle of pound symbols -->

    <!-- To make this, I used both an array and for loop. by adding 1 pound, 2 pounds, 3 pounds, 4 pounds, until 7 pounds into the array, I set it so that it would know when to print out each item. -->

    <!-- In the for loop, I made it so that i would be smaller than 7. And since i is set to 0, it would print out that 0 would equal to #, and then adding onto that with the i++, it would ensure that a pound would be added on with the array I had set. Therefore the code would only run until 7 lines, with line 1 being 0(#).  -->
